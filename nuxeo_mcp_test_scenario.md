# Nuxeo MCP Server Test Scenario

This document provides step-by-step instructions to test the Nuxeo MCP Server. Follow these instructions to verify that the server is working correctly and to learn how to use its various tools and resources.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this test scenario, ensure that:
1. The Nuxeo MCP Server is installed and running
2. A Nuxeo server is accessible (either locally or remotely)
3. You have valid credentials for the Nuxeo server

## Step 1: Verify Connection to the Nuxeo Server

Let's start by checking if we can connect to the Nuxeo server and retrieve basic information.

```python
# Use the get_repository_info tool to check the connection
repository_info = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_repository_info", {})

# Print the repository information
print("Repository Information:")
print(f"Name: {repository_info.get('name', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Version: {repository_info.get('version', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Root ID: {repository_info.get('rootId', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: Information about the Nuxeo repository, including its name, version, and root ID.

**Please confirm that you can connect to the Nuxeo server before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 2: Access Server Information via Resource

Now, let's try accessing the server information using a resource instead of a tool.

```python
# Access the nuxeo://info resource
server_info = access_resource("nuxeo", "nuxeo://info")

# Print the server information
print("Server Information:")
print(f"URL: {server_info.get('url', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Username: {server_info.get('username', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Connected: {server_info.get('connected', False)}")
```

Expected output: Information about the Nuxeo server, including the URL, username, and connection status.

**Please confirm that you can access the server information before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 3: Browse the Repository Root

Let's explore the repository by getting the children of the root document.

```python
# Use the get_children tool to get the children of the root document
root_children = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_children", {"path": "/"})

# Print the children
print("Root Children:")
for child in root_children:
    print(f"- {child.get('title', 'N/A')} ({child.get('type', 'N/A')}) at {child.get('path', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: A list of documents at the root of the repository, typically including "Domain" documents.

**Please confirm that you can browse the repository root before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 4: Navigate to the Default Domain

Now, let's navigate to the default domain and explore its contents.

```python
# Use the get_children tool to get the children of the default domain
domain_children = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_children", {"path": "/default-domain"})

# Print the children
print("Default Domain Children:")
for child in domain_children:
    print(f"- {child.get('title', 'N/A')} ({child.get('type', 'N/A')}) at {child.get('path', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: A list of documents in the default domain, typically including "Workspaces", "Templates", and "Sections".

**Please confirm that you can navigate to the default domain before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 5: Navigate to the Workspaces

Let's navigate to the Workspaces section and explore its contents.

```python
# Use the get_children tool to get the children of the Workspaces section
workspaces_children = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_children", {"path": "/default-domain/workspaces"})

# Print the children
print("Workspaces Children:")
for child in workspaces_children:
    print(f"- {child.get('title', 'N/A')} ({child.get('type', 'N/A')}) at {child.get('path', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: A list of workspaces in the Workspaces section.

**Please confirm that you can navigate to the Workspaces section before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 6: Create a Test Workspace

Let's create a new workspace for our tests.

```python
import uuid

# Generate a unique name for the workspace
workspace_name = f"MCP Test Workspace {uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"

# Use the create_document tool to create a new workspace
workspace = use_tool("nuxeo", "create_document", {
    "parent_path": "/default-domain/workspaces",
    "name": workspace_name.replace(" ", "_").lower(),
    "type": "Workspace",
    "properties": {
        "dc:title": workspace_name,
        "dc:description": "A workspace created for testing the Nuxeo MCP Server"
    }
})

# Print the workspace information
print("Created Workspace:")
print(f"Title: {workspace.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Path: {workspace.get('path', 'N/A')}")
print(f"ID: {workspace.get('uid', 'N/A')}")

# Store the workspace path and uid for later use
workspace_path = workspace.get('path')
workspace_uid = workspace.get('uid')
```

Expected output: Information about the newly created workspace, including its title, path, and ID.

**Please confirm that you can create a test workspace before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 7: Create a File Document with Attachment

Now, let's create a file document in our test workspace and attach a file to it.

```python
# First, create a simple text file to attach
with open("test_attachment.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is a test file for the Nuxeo MCP Server.")

# Use the create_document tool to create a new file document
file_doc = use_tool("nuxeo", "create_document", {
    "parent_path": workspace_path,
    "name": "test_file",
    "type": "File",
    "properties": {
        "dc:title": "Test File",
        "dc:description": "A file created for testing the Nuxeo MCP Server"
    }
})

# Print the file document information
print("Created File Document:")
print(f"Title: {file_doc.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Path: {file_doc.get('path', 'N/A')}")
print(f"ID: {file_doc.get('uid', 'N/A')}")

# Store the file document path and uid for later use
file_doc_path = file_doc.get('path')
file_doc_uid = file_doc.get('uid')

# Now attach the file to the document using the Blob.AttachOnDocument operation
attachment_result = use_tool("nuxeo", "execute_operation", {
    "operation_id": "Blob.AttachOnDocument",
    "params": {
        "document": file_doc_path,
        "xpath": "file:content"
    },
    "input_type": "file",
    "file_path": "test_attachment.txt"
})

print("Attachment Result:")
print(attachment_result)
```

Expected output: Information about the newly created file document, including its title, path, and ID, followed by the result of attaching a file to it.

**Please confirm that you can create a file document with an attachment before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 8: Create a Note Document with Rich Text Content

Let's also create a note document in our test workspace with rich text content.

```python
# Use the create_document tool to create a new note document
note_doc = use_tool("nuxeo", "create_document", {
    "parent_path": workspace_path,
    "name": "test_note",
    "type": "Note",
    "properties": {
        "dc:title": "Test Note",
        "dc:description": "A note created for testing the Nuxeo MCP Server",
        "note:note": "<h1>Test Note Content</h1><p>This is a <strong>rich text</strong> note with <em>formatting</em>.</p><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ul><p>It contains various HTML elements to test full-text search capabilities.</p>"
    }
})

# Print the note document information
print("Created Note Document:")
print(f"Title: {note_doc.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Path: {note_doc.get('path', 'N/A')}")
print(f"ID: {note_doc.get('uid', 'N/A')}")

# Store the note document path and uid for later use
note_doc_path = note_doc.get('path')
note_doc_uid = note_doc.get('uid')
```

Expected output: Information about the newly created note document, including its title, path, and ID.

**Please confirm that you can create a note document with rich text content before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 9: Search for Documents by Type

Now that we have created some content, let's search for documents in the repository using a NXQL query.

```python
# Use the search tool to search for documents by type
search_results = use_tool("nuxeo", "search", {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:primaryType = 'File'",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "currentPageIndex": 0
})

# Print the search results
print("Search Results by Type:")
print(f"Total Results: {search_results.get('resultsCount', 0)}")
print("Documents:")
for doc in search_results.get('entries', []):
    print(f"- {doc.get('title', 'N/A')} ({doc.get('type', 'N/A')}) at {doc.get('path', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: A list of File documents in the repository, including our newly created file document.

**Please confirm that you can search for documents by type before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 10: Search for Documents with Full-Text Search

Let's search for documents using full-text search capabilities.

```python
# Use the search tool to search for documents using full-text search
fulltext_search_results = use_tool("nuxeo", "search", {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext = 'rich text formatting'",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "currentPageIndex": 0
})

# Print the search results
print("Full-Text Search Results:")
print(f"Total Results: {fulltext_search_results.get('resultsCount', 0)}")
print("Documents:")
for doc in fulltext_search_results.get('entries', []):
    print(f"- {doc.get('title', 'N/A')} ({doc.get('type', 'N/A')}) at {doc.get('path', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: A list of documents containing the text "rich text formatting", which should include our note document.

**Please confirm that you can search for documents using full-text search before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 11: Get Document Details

Let's retrieve detailed information about the file document we created.

```python
# Use the get_document tool to get the file document details
file_doc_details = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_document", {
    "path": file_doc_path
})

# Print the file document details
print("File Document Details:")
print(f"Title: {file_doc_details.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Type: {file_doc_details.get('type', 'N/A')}")
print(f"State: {file_doc_details.get('state', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Last Modified: {file_doc_details.get('lastModified', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Creator: {file_doc_details.get('properties', {}).get('dc:creator', 'N/A')}")

# Get the file content
file_content = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_document", {
    "path": file_doc_path,
    "fetch_blob": True
})

print("File Content Available:", file_content is not None)
```

Expected output: Detailed information about the file document, including its title, type, state, last modified date, and creator, followed by confirmation that the file content is available.

**Please confirm that you can get document details and content before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 12: Update the File Document

Let's update the file document by changing its title and description.

```python
# Use the update_document tool to update the file document
updated_file_doc = use_tool("nuxeo", "update_document", {
    "path": file_doc_path,
    "properties": {
        "dc:title": "Updated Test File",
        "dc:description": "This file has been updated"
    }
})

# Print the updated file document information
print("Updated File Document:")
print(f"Title: {updated_file_doc.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Description: {updated_file_doc.get('properties', {}).get('dc:description', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: Information about the updated file document, including its new title and description.

**Please confirm that you can update a document before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 13: Get Document via Resource

Let's try accessing the note document using a resource instead of a tool.

```python
# Access the document resource
note_doc_resource = access_resource("nuxeo", f"nuxeo://document{note_doc_path}")

# Print the note document information
print("Note Document from Resource:")
print(f"Title: {note_doc_resource.get('title', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Type: {note_doc_resource.get('type', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Note Content: {note_doc_resource.get('properties', {}).get('note:note', 'N/A')}")
```

Expected output: Information about the note document, including its title, type, and note content.

**Please confirm that you can access a document via resource before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 14: Delete the File Document

Now, let's delete the file document using its UID.

```python
# Use the delete_document tool to delete the file document
delete_result = use_tool("nuxeo", "delete_document", {
    "uid": file_doc_uid
})

# Print the delete result
print("Delete Result:")
print(delete_result)

# Try to get the deleted document to verify it's gone
try:
    deleted_doc = use_tool("nuxeo", "get_document", {
        "path": file_doc_path
    })
    print("Document still exists!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Document was successfully deleted: {e}")
```

Expected output: Confirmation that the document was deleted, and an error when trying to retrieve it.

**Please confirm that you can delete a document before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 15: Delete the Note Document

Let's also delete the note document using its UID.

```python
# Use the delete_document tool to delete the note document
delete_result = use_tool("nuxeo", "delete_document", {
    "uid": note_doc_uid
})

# Print the delete result
print("Delete Result:")
print(delete_result)
```

Expected output: Confirmation that the document was deleted.

**Please confirm that you can delete the note document before proceeding to the next step.**

## Step 16: Delete the Test Workspace

Finally, let's clean up by deleting the test workspace using its UID.

```python
# Use the delete_document tool to delete the test workspace
delete_result = use_tool("nuxeo", "delete_document", {
    "uid": workspace_uid
})

# Print the delete result
print("Delete Result:")
print(delete_result)
```

Expected output: Confirmation that the workspace was deleted.

**Please confirm that you can delete the test workspace.**
