I have upgraded fastmcp to the latest version.

I also modified the return types and signature of tools.
I added prompt and prompt templates.

The code works.

Update the unit tests and the integration tests to work - do not modify the code of the MCP Serevr - only adjust the test unless you find something wrong.
